# MarkovChains_DiscreteContinuous
Exploring Markov Chains to simulate event propagation across a graph. Events can infection, rumours, or failures.
In the case of infection or rumours, the nodes are people and states are their health or knowledge status.
In the case of failures the nodes are system components (or sensors) and their states are their operational status 

The tool that I am using is SymPy: https://docs.sympy.org
